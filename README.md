## Fighter Effects System

### Overview
The fighter effects system manages all modifications to fighter statistics through a unified interface. Effects can come from various sources:
- Injuries
- Advancements
- Bionics
- Cyberteknika
- Gene-smithing
- Rig-glitches
- Augmentations
- Equipment
- Vehicle Lasting Damages
- User modifications

### Data Structure
```typescript
// Core effect interface
interface FighterEffect {
  id?: string;
  effect_name: string;
  fighter_effect_modifiers: Array<{
    id: string;
    fighter_effect_id: string;
    stat_name: string;
    numeric_value: number;
  }>;
}

// Fighter effects structure
interface Fighter {
  effects: {
    injuries: FighterEffect[];
    advancements: FighterEffect[];
    bionics: FighterEffect[];
    cyberteknika: FighterEffect[];
    'gene-smithing': FighterEffect[];
    'rig-glitches': FighterEffect[];
    augmentations: FighterEffect[];
    equipment: FighterEffect[];
    vehicle_damages: FighterEffect[];
    user: FighterEffect[];
  }
}
```

### How It Works

1. **Effect Categories**
   - Each effect belongs to a specific category (injury, advancement, vehicle damage, etc.)
   - Categories are stored in the `fighter_effect_categories` table
   - Each category can have different business rules and UI treatments

2. **Stat Modifications**
   - Effects modify fighter stats through `fighter_effect_modifiers`
   - Each modifier specifies:
     - Which stat to modify (`stat_name`)
     - How much to modify it by (`numeric_value`)
     - Reference to its parent effect (`fighter_effect_id`)

3. **Stat Calculation**
   ```typescript
   function calculateAdjustedStats(fighter: Fighter) {
     // Start with base stats
     const adjustedStats = { ...fighter.base_stats };

     // Process all effect categories
     ['injuries', 'advancements', 'bionics', 'cyberteknika', 'gene-smithing', 'rig-glitches', 'augmentations', 'equipment', 'vehicle_damages', 'user'].forEach(category => {
       fighter.effects[category]?.forEach(effect => {
         effect.fighter_effect_modifiers?.forEach(modifier => {
           const statName = modifier.stat_name.toLowerCase();
           adjustedStats[statName] += modifier.numeric_value;
         });
       });
     });

     return adjustedStats;
   }
   ```

4. **Database Schema**
   ```sql
   -- Effect categories
   CREATE TABLE fighter_effect_categories (
     id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
     category_name TEXT NOT NULL,
     created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
     updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ
   );

   -- Effects
   CREATE TABLE fighter_effects (
     id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
     fighter_id UUID REFERENCES fighters(id),
     vehicle_id UUID REFERENCES vehicles(id),
     effect_name TEXT NOT NULL,
     category_id UUID REFERENCES fighter_effect_categories(id),
     created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
   );

   -- Effect modifiers
   CREATE TABLE fighter_effect_modifiers (
     id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
     fighter_effect_id UUID REFERENCES fighter_effects(id),
     stat_name TEXT NOT NULL,
     numeric_value INTEGER NOT NULL
   );
   ```

### Usage Examples

1. **Adding an Injury**
   ```typescript
   const injury: FighterEffect = {
     effect_name: "Head Wound",
     fighter_effect_modifiers: [{
       stat_name: "ballistic_skill",
       numeric_value: -1
     }]
   };
   fighter.effects.injuries.push(injury);
   ```

2. **Adding a Bionic Enhancement**
   ```typescript
   const bionic: FighterEffect = {
     effect_name: "Bionic Arm",
     fighter_effect_modifiers: [{
       stat_name: "strength",
       numeric_value: 1
     }]
   };
   fighter.effects.bionics.push(bionic);
   ```

3. **Adding Equipment Effects**
   ```typescript
   const equipmentEffect: FighterEffect = {
     effect_name: "Psychomancer's harness",
     fighter_effect_modifiers: [
       {
         stat_name: "movement",
         numeric_value: 2
       }
     ]
   };
   fighter.effects.equipment.push(equipmentEffect);
   ```

4. **Adding a Vehicle Lasting Damage**
   ```typescript
   const vehicleDamage: FighterEffect = {
     effect_name: "Loss of Power",
     vehicle_id: "vehicle-uuid",
     fighter_effect_modifiers: [{
       stat_name: "movement",
       numeric_value: -1
     }]
   };
   fighter.effects.vehicle_damages.push(vehicleDamage);
   ```

5. **User Modification**
   ```typescript
   const userMod: FighterEffect = {
     effect_name: "Custom Bonus",
     fighter_effect_modifiers: [{
       stat_name: "movement",
       numeric_value: 1
     }]
   };
   fighter.effects.user.push(userMod);
   ```

## Gang Logging System

### Overview
The gang logging system provides comprehensive tracking of all changes and activities within your gang. Every action is automatically logged with timestamps, creating a complete audit trail of your gang's history.

### Features
- **Automatic Logging**: All gang activities are tracked automatically through database triggers
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Logs credits, reputation, fighters, equipment, vehicles, and more
- **Detailed Descriptions**: Human-readable log entries with before/after values
- **Real-time Updates**: Logs appear immediately after actions are performed
- **Paginated Display**: Clean interface with 10 logs per page for easy browsing

### Logged Activities

#### Gang Changes
- **Credits**: "Credits increased from 500 to 600" or "Credits decreased from 600 to 500"
- **Reputation**: "Reputation changed from 5 to 10"
- **Resources**: Meat and exploration points changes
- **Gang Type**: Gang alignment and type modifications

#### Fighter Operations
- **Fighter Management**: "Added fighter 'Juve' (65 credits). New gang rating: 365"
- **Fighter Removal**: "Removed fighter 'Ganger' (95 credits). New gang rating: 270"
- **Status Changes**: Fighter deaths, retirements, enslavement with context
- **Cost Adjustments**: Manual fighter cost modifications
- **Experience & Kills**: XP gains and kill count changes

#### Equipment Transactions
- **Purchases**: "Fighter 'Ganger' bought Lasgun for 15 credits. New gang rating: 280"
- **Sales**: "Fighter 'Heavy' sold Plasma gun for 100 credits. New gang rating: 380"
- **Stash Operations**: 
  - "Fighter moved Heavy bolter to gang stash. New gang rating: 265"
  - "Fighter took Plasma gun from gang stash. New gang rating: 365"

#### Vehicle Operations
- **Vehicle Management**: "Added vehicle 'Cargo-8 Ridgehauler' (130 credits). New gang rating: 495"
- **Vehicle Equipment**: "Vehicle 'Ridgehauler' bought Heavy bolter for 160 credits. New gang rating: 655"
- **Vehicle Modifications**: Upgrades, repairs, and customizations

### Technical Implementation

#### Database Triggers
The logging system uses PostgreSQL triggers that fire automatically on data changes:

```sql
-- Gang changes trigger
CREATE TRIGGER gang_changes_trigger
    AFTER UPDATE ON gangs
    FOR EACH ROW
    EXECUTE FUNCTION auto_log_gang_changes();

-- Fighter changes trigger  
CREATE TRIGGER fighter_changes_trigger
    AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON fighters
    FOR EACH ROW
    EXECUTE FUNCTION fighter_logs();

-- Equipment triggers
CREATE TRIGGER fighter_equipment_trigger
    AFTER INSERT OR DELETE ON fighter_equipment
    FOR EACH ROW
    EXECUTE FUNCTION fighter_equipment_logs();
```

#### Smart Duplicate Prevention
The system prevents duplicate logging by checking for recent related activities:
- Credit decreases from equipment purchases don't create separate credit logs
- Fighter additions don't duplicate credit change logs
- Equipment stash operations are distinguished from regular sales/purchases

#### Data Structure
```typescript
interface GangLog {
  id: string;
  gang_id: string;
  user_id: string;
  action_type: string;
  description: string;
  fighter_id?: string;
  vehicle_id?: string;
  created_at: string;
}
```

### User Interface
- **Modal Display**: Logs open in a responsive modal dialog
- **Table Format**: Clean 3-column layout (Date, Type, Description)
- **Pagination**: Navigate through logs with page controls
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing
- **Real-time Updates**: New logs appear immediately without page refresh

### Access
Gang logs are accessible via the "Logs" button on each gang page, positioned next to the Edit button. The logs are private to the gang owner and provide a complete history of all gang activities.

## Notification System

  type: 'info' | 'warning' | 'error' | 'invite';
  created_at: string;
  dismissed: boolean;
  link: string | null;
}
```

### Database Integration
- Notifications are stored in the `notifications` table
- Database triggers automatically create notifications for specific events
- Example functions:
  - `notify_campaign_member_added()`: Creates notifications when users are invited to campaigns
